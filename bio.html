<p><h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
<br>

I was born and raised in New York City.  I graduated from the Ethical Culture Fieldston School 
in 2009. In my free time, I played piano, competed on the swim team, and played video games.</p>

<br>

<p><h3>Hobbies</h3>
<br>

I love cooking.  Right now my specialties are chicken marsala and spinach artichoke dip.  I also
am a huge music person.  I enjoy pretty much all music, and my favorite genre is classic rock (my
favorite band is Led Zeppelin).</p>
