Assignment 3
Beckylee Dell

1.  Everything that's up is working so far.  The T stops won't let the little info bubble show up, and I haven't put the up to date info in there yet.

Sometimes it's really slow to load, so I put a little note to refresh on the page.

2.  A little support from Phil Tang, very minor.

3. I've spent about 8 hours so far.
